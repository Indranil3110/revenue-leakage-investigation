**Revenue Leakage Investigation – Churn & Early Warning Analysis**

## 1. Context

Finance and Growth teams observed a recurring gap between expected Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and actual cash collected over recent quarters.

This analysis simulates an internal investigation for a subscription-based SaaS business to:
- Identify where revenue leakage occurs (churn, billing failures, downgrades)
- Quantify the financial impact across customer segments and plans
- Design an early-warning system to proactively flag at-risk customers before revenue loss occurs
